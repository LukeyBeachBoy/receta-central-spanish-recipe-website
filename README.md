# Receta Central

## What is it?
This was an assignment I submitted during my year abroad in Alicante. It was part of the Web Development module I took and the aim of the project was to learn about the concepts of Mobile-First and Responsive Design by creating a website of my choice.
This is still a work in progress and not all functionalities are implemented, the aim was to learn more about the design elements than implementing a functional site.

## Functionalities
- Fluid, responsive and mobile first design. Various elements will reposition and resize themselves as the screen size changes.
- Interactable menu-bar created with CSS.
- Basic recipe information. The aim was to extend this with a RESTful api so that it would not be static information.

### Fun-Fact
After learning the basics of web design and moving on from this project, I recently had the opportunity to work as a group to create a web app for our final year project. We agreed to make a recipe website based on fitness and calories, which can be found here until the end of 2019: https://www.snackmate.co.uk. It was nice to come back to this idea and finish it fully with the help of a team.
